###### Vacation Spot: Hyderabad
Hyderabad is my favourite vacation spot in india where I completed my bachelors and got so many friends and enjoyed a lot with them. We used to go to **malls** on weekends, watch movies and do lot of fun with them. Maily we used to play badminton. One day we went to **music concert** of Anirudh in kukatpally.
